# MDN-web-doc_Express-Tutorial

This repository is **[MDN web doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)**'s **[Express tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side)** sample as well as my memorandum.
So, this was made by along the tutorial.

However, it have one difference. In the tutorial, it's mongooseDB made in **[mLab](https://mlab.com/welcome/)**. But I make it in **Local**. This reason is that mLab seems what it cannot use in Japan. 

It is only my memorandum, but if it is useful for someone, I feel happy.
